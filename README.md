# HR Analytics Project on Employee Attrition 📊

## Overview 👀
Hey there! Welcome to my HR Analytics project, where I dive deep into the world of employee attrition. This project is all about understanding why employees leave and using data to predict who might leave next. 🕵️‍♂️

## Objectives 🎯
- Unravel the mysteries behind employee attrition.
- Develop a machine learning model to foresee potential attrition risks.
- Share insights that can help HR to keep the team happy and intact. 🤗

## My Journey Through Data 🧭
- Started with the dataset, which was quite a mess at first! I cleaned it up by removing unnecessary columns and sorting out missing values.
- I then played detective 🕵️‍♀️ with the data, exploring various employee attributes like age, job roles, and more.
- Dived into a correlation analysis to see how different factors were interlinked.

## Building the Predictive Model 🔨
- Chose logistic regression for the prediction - a bit of a classic but works like a charm!
- The model turned out to be a star at predicting who's likely to stick around, although it was a bit shy at predicting who might leave.

## What I Found Out 📝
- Turns out, things like how often someone does overtime, their job role, and even their marital status can wave red flags 🚩 about attrition risks.
- The model showed me that predicting attrition isn't just black and white; it's a kaleidoscope of factors!

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Python**: My trusty sidekick for all things data.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: My go-to for data wrangling.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Made my data look pretty and understandable.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For bringing my logistic regression model to life.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Where all my data magic happened. 🧙‍♂️

## Conclusion 🏁
This project was an eye-opener! It taught me that understanding employee attrition is like solving a puzzle with many pieces. While my model did a great job in some areas, it also showed me that there's always more to learn and improve.
